<h1>🚀 Inshorts Clone - Responsive Website 🌐</h1>

<h4>Website link : https://inshorts-webapp.vercel.app/en/read</h4>

<p>I built an Inshorts clone using Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on a clean, user-friendly interface with smooth performance across devices. Key features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🌐 <strong>Multiple Language Support</strong></li>
  <li>⚡ <strong>Real-time News Fetching</strong> from a public API</li>
  <li>📱 <strong>Fully Responsive Design</strong> using Tailwind CSS for mobile, tablet, and desktop</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was deployed on Vercel, helping me refine my skills in React.js, Tailwind CSS, API integration, and optimizing performance with Next.js.</p>
